## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

These must be set for the application to run:

```bash
# OpenAI API key for embeddings and GPT models
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...

# Anthropic API key for Claude models
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Logfire token for observability
LOGFIRE_TOKEN=...

# PostgreSQL database URL (with pgvector extension)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname
```

### Optional Variables

```bash
# Generation Settings
MAX_TOKENS=4000                          # Answer generation token limit

```

## Security & Deployment Posture

This is a **demo template**. It ships intentionally open so a one-click deploy just works,
which means a few things you should understand (and tighten) before exposing a fork publicly:

- **No authentication.** There is no login, API key, or session auth on any endpoint. History
  is scoped only by an anonymous, client-generated `client_id` (a random UUID in the browser's
  `localStorage`) — this separates users' views but is **not** a security boundary.
- **`POST /ask` is unauthenticated and unthrottled, and it costs money.** Every call triggers
  the full pipeline — OpenAI **and** Anthropic requests billed to your keys. If you deploy a
  public fork, anyone who finds the URL can drive up your LLM bill. Before exposing it, add
  authentication and/or rate limiting (e.g. [slowapi](https://github.com/laurentS/slowapi)
  per-IP, or a per-`client_id` cap) in `backend/main.py`.
- **CORS defaults to `*`.** `CORS_ORIGINS` defaults to a wildcard so the demo works from any
  origin. This is safe *only* because credentials are disabled (`allow_credentials=False` in
  `backend/main.py`), which is why browsers permit a wildcard origin at all. In production,
  set `CORS_ORIGINS` to your frontend origin(s).
- **Read endpoints are ownership-scoped.** `GET /history/{id}` and `GET /sessions/{id}/logs`
  require the caller's `client_id` and only return a session that `client_id` owns — matching
  the `DELETE` routes. Session IDs are unguessable UUIDs, but the scoping keeps reads and
  deletes consistent.
- **Secrets** live only in environment variables (never committed); `render.yaml` marks all
  secrets `sync: false` so Render prompts for them on first apply.

For a production deployment: add auth + rate limiting to `POST /ask`, set `CORS_ORIGINS` to
your real origin, and set `ENVIRONMENT` appropriately so Logfire traces are grouped correctly.

## Pipeline Configuration

Edit `backend/config.py` to customize pipeline behavior:

### Basic Configuration

```python
class PipelineConfig:
    # Performance tuning
    MAX_TOKENS = 2000                # Output token limit for generation
    TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30             # Per-stage timeout in seconds
    
    # RAG configuration
    RAG_TOP_K = 10                   # Number of documents to retrieve
    SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.75      # Minimum similarity score
    BM25_WEIGHT = 0.4                # BM25 weight in hybrid search (0-1)
    EMBEDDING_MODEL = "text-embedding-3-small"
    EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS = 1536
    
    # Model selection
    ANSWER_MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
    CLAIMS_MODEL = "gpt-5.4-mini"
    ACCURACY_MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
    EVAL_MODELS = ["gpt-5.4-mini", "claude-sonnet-4-6"]
```

## Model Selection

### Available Models

#### OpenAI Models

```python
# Embedding models
"text-embedding-3-small"    # Recommended, good balance of cost/quality
"text-embedding-3-large"    # Higher quality, more expensive
"text-embedding-ada-002"    # Legacy model, not recommended

# Chat models
"gpt-5.4-mini"              # Latest, recommended
"gpt-4-turbo"               # Previous generation
"gpt-3.5-turbo"             # Cheapest, lower quality
```

#### Anthropic Models

```python
"claude-opus-4-8"             # Most capable, most expensive
"claude-sonnet-4-6"           # Latest Sonnet, best balance (default)
"claude-haiku-4-5"            # Fast and cheap
```

### Model Selection Strategy

**Cost-Optimized:**
```python
ANSWER_MODEL = "claude-haiku-4-5"          # Cheapest Claude
CLAIMS_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"           # Cheapest OpenAI
ACCURACY_MODEL = "gpt-5.4-mini"          # Balance
EVAL_MODEL_OPENAI = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
EVAL_MODEL_ANTHROPIC = "claude-haiku-4-5"
```

**Quality-Optimized:**
```python
ANSWER_MODEL = "claude-opus-4-8"           # Best Anthropic
CLAIMS_MODEL = "gpt-5.4-mini"            # Best OpenAI for structured output
ACCURACY_MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
EVAL_MODEL_OPENAI = "gpt-5.4-mini"
EVAL_MODEL_ANTHROPIC = "claude-opus-4-8"
```

**Balanced (Default):**
```python
ANSWER_MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-6"  # Good balance
CLAIMS_MODEL = "gpt-5.4-mini"                # Fast and cheap
ACCURACY_MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-6"  # Reliable
EVAL_MODEL_OPENAI = "gpt-5.4-mini"
EVAL_MODEL_ANTHROPIC = "claude-sonnet-4-6"
```

## RAG Configuration

### Hybrid Search Parameters

```python
# Number of documents to retrieve
RAG_TOP_K = 10  # Increase for more context, decrease for faster retrieval

# Minimum similarity threshold (0-1)
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.75  # Lower = more permissive, higher = more strict

# BM25 weight (0-1)
# 0 = pure semantic search
# 1 = pure BM25 lexical search
# 0.4 = 60% semantic, 40% BM25 (recommended)
BM25_WEIGHT = 0.4

# RRF constant (for combining rankings)
RRF_K = 60  # Lower = more weight to top-ranked items
```

### Embedding Configuration

```python
# Embedding model
EMBEDDING_MODEL = "text-embedding-3-small"

# Embedding dimensions
EMBEDDING_DIMENSIONS = 1536  # Must match model

# Batch size for embedding generation
EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE = 100

# Enable embedding caching
ENABLE_EMBEDDING_CACHE = True
```

### Document Chunking

Edit `data/scripts/generate_embeddings.py`:

```python
# Chunk size (characters)
CHUNK_SIZE = 1000  # Larger = more context, fewer chunks

# Chunk overlap (characters)
CHUNK_OVERLAP = 200  # Overlap between chunks for continuity

# Minimum chunk size
MIN_CHUNK_SIZE = 100  # Discard very small chunks
```

---

## Performance Tuning

### Latency Optimization

```python
# Reduce token limits
MAX_TOKENS = 1500  # Down from 2000

# Reduce retrieval count
RAG_TOP_K = 5  # Down from 10

# Use faster models
ANSWER_MODEL = "claude-haiku-4-5"  # Faster than Sonnet

# Disable less critical stages (not recommended)
ENABLE_CLAIMS_VERIFICATION = False
ENABLE_ACCURACY_CHECK = False
```

### Cost Optimization

```python
# Use cheaper models
ANSWER_MODEL = "claude-haiku-4-5"
CLAIMS_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
ACCURACY_MODEL = "gpt-5.4-mini"

# Reduce token limits
MAX_TOKENS = 1000

# Enable aggressive caching
ENABLE_CACHING = True
CACHE_TTL_SECONDS = 3600  # 1 hour
```

### Quality Optimization

```python
# Use best models
ANSWER_MODEL = "claude-opus-4-8"
CLAIMS_MODEL = "gpt-5.4-mini"
ACCURACY_MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-6"

# Increase token limits
MAX_TOKENS = 3000

# More RAG context
RAG_TOP_K = 15
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Pipeline times out:**
```python
# Increase timeout
TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 60

# Or reduce token limit
MAX_TOKENS = 1500
```

**Poor retrieval quality:**
```python
# Improve RAG retrieval
RAG_TOP_K = 15
SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.70
```

**Costs too high:**
```python
# Use cheaper models
ANSWER_MODEL = "claude-haiku-4-5"
CLAIMS_MODEL = "gpt-3.5-turbo"

# Reduce token limit
MAX_TOKENS = 1000
```

**Low quality scores:**
```python
# Use better models
ANSWER_MODEL = "claude-sonnet-4-6"

# More context
RAG_TOP_K = 15

# More output tokens
MAX_TOKENS = 2500
```
