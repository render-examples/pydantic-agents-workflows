"""Shared helpers for ingesting live sources into the RAG vector store.

Every live source follows the same shape — *build* its documents, *embed* them,
then *replace* the source's rows transactionally. These two helpers hold the
embed loop and the delete-by-source + insert block that every source shares.

A "doc" is a plain dict produced by a source builder (see ``data/sources.py``):

    {"content": str, "title": str, "section": str | None, "metadata": dict}

``embed_documents`` adds an ``"embedding"`` key; ``replace_source`` writes the
embedded docs to the ``documents`` table.
