## What This App Does

This is an **AI-powered Q&A assistant for Render documentation**. Users can ask questions about Render's platform, and the app provides accurate, well-researched answers backed by the official documentation.

### User Experience

1. **Ask a question** - "How do I deploy a Node.js app on Render?" or "What database plans are available?"
2. **Watch the pipeline** - Track progress as the run moves through 7 stages (embedding → retrieval → generation → verification)
3. **Get accurate answers** - Receive detailed responses with sources from Render docs
4. **Quality guaranteed** - Every answer is verified for accuracy and rated by dual AI evaluators

### Key Features

- **Hybrid search** - Combines semantic understanding with keyword matching for better retrieval
- **Three verification capabilities** - Each answer goes through *Grounding* (extract claims, verify them against the retrieved sources), *Accuracy* (a factual-correctness review), and *Quality* (a dual-model developer-experience rating) — distinct checks, not redundant ones
- **Neutral, grounded answers** - The assistant answers only from retrieved documentation, with no product-favorable steering in the prompt; relevant Render docs surface through retrieval, not by being force-sold
- **Cost tracking** - See exactly how much each question costs to answer
- **Parallel fan-out** - The pipeline runs on [Render Workflows](https://render.com/docs/workflows), fanning out the Accuracy + dual-model Quality checks across instances so they execute concurrently

---

## What This Demonstrates

### Render Capabilities

- **Render Workflows** - The Q&A pipeline and ingestion run as durable workflow tasks with per-task retries, timeouts, and cross-instance parallel fan-out
- **PostgreSQL with pgvector + full-text** - Managed hybrid search database
- **Web Service + Static Site** - FastAPI gateway + Next.js frontend
- **Cron Jobs** - Scheduled ingestion refresh that triggers the workflow fan-out
- **Blueprint deploy + env groups** - `render.yaml` provisions everything; shared config lives in two env groups

### Logfire Features

- **LLM Traces** - Complete visibility into every AI call (OpenAI + Anthropic auto-instrumented)
- **HTTP Tracing** - FastAPI auto-instrumentation for request/response tracking
- **Database Monitoring** - AsyncPG auto-instrumentation for query performance
- **Cost Tracking** - Per-stage and per-execution cost attribution with custom metrics
- **Multi-Model Evals** - Dual-rater quality assessment (OpenAI + Anthropic)
- **Session Tracking** - End-to-end user journey with distributed tracing
- **Custom Metrics** - Business-specific metrics (cost, quality, accuracy)
- **SQL Queries** - Custom analytics on AI performance

### Pydantic Stack

This project is built end-to-end on the [Pydantic](https://pydantic.dev/) ecosystem:

- **[Pydantic AI Agents](https://ai.pydantic.dev/agents/)** — every pipeline stage (generation, claims extraction, accuracy check, dual-rater evaluation) is a `pydantic_ai.Agent` with a typed `output_type`. Multi-provider orchestration (Claude + GPT) runs through `OpenAIProvider` / `AnthropicProvider` in a single pipeline. See [`backend/pipeline/`](./backend/pipeline/).
- **[Pydantic Embedder](https://ai.pydantic.dev/embeddings/)** — `pydantic_ai.Embedder` with `OpenAIEmbeddingModel` powers question embedding (`embed_query`) and batch claim embedding (`embed_documents`) for verification. Auto-instrumented by `logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()`. See [`backend/pipeline/embeddings.py`](./backend/pipeline/embeddings.py) and [`backend/pipeline/verification.py`](./backend/pipeline/verification.py).
- **[Pydantic Models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)** — Claims, accuracy scores, eval dimensions, and pipeline state are parsed directly into Pydantic models (e.g. `ClaimsOutput`, `EvaluationOutput`). `pydantic-settings` manages config in [`backend/config.py`](./backend/config.py).
- **[Pydantic GenAI Prices](https://github.com/pydantic/genai-prices)** — model pricing is loaded dynamically from the `pydantic/genai-prices` registry, then combined with per-agent token counts from `result.usage()` to produce per-stage cost attribution. See [`backend/prices.py`](./backend/prices.py).
- **[Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/)** — distributed traces, custom metrics, dual-model evals, and cost attribution. Auto-instruments FastAPI, AsyncPG, HTTPX, and Pydantic AI. See [`backend/observability.py`](./backend/observability.py).

## Architecture

Only the static site and the `api` gateway are public. The gateway triggers **Render Workflows** runs over the Render SDK and polls them for results; the workflows service is private and never HTTP-facing. Both talk to one managed Postgres, and both call out to your LLM providers with your own API keys.

```

                      └─────────────────────┘  └────────────────────────────┘
```

The `api` service also reads Postgres directly — live run progress (the orchestrator writes
stage updates there, and `GET /ask/{run_id}` reads them back), plus `/history`, `/stats`, and
`/sessions/{id}/logs`. The workflows service is created in the Dashboard rather than in
[`render.yaml`](./render.yaml); everything else in the diagram is Blueprint-managed.

### Pipeline stages

`run_qa_pipeline` orchestrates seven stages, promoting only the expensive ones to their own tasks:

| # | Stage | Model | Execution |
|---|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | Question embedding | OpenAI embeddings | in-process |
| 2 | Hybrid retrieval (pgvector + BM25, LLM multi-query expansion) | `gpt-4.1-nano` | in-process |
| 3 | Answer generation | Claude | subtask (3 retries) |
| 4 | Claims extraction | GPT | subtask |
| 5 | Claims verification (RAG) | OpenAI embeddings | subtask |
| 6 | Factual-grounding check | Claude | subtask, parallel with 7 |
| 7 | Dual-model quality rating | OpenAI + Anthropic | 2 subtasks, parallel with 6 |

Ingestion runs the same way: `ingest_all` → `ingest_core`, then `ingest_source` fanned out over
the source registry in [`data/sources.py`](./data/sources.py). A daily cron job triggers it, and
the `api` service re-seeds pre-embedded pages in its `preDeployCommand`.

> **Why hybrid?** Workflows aren't HTTP-facing, so a client (the gateway) triggers tasks
> via the SDK and reads run status. Stages 1 and 2 are cheap/data-dependent and stay
> in-process on the orchestrator; only the heavy, independently-retryable LLM stages are
> promoted to their own tasks. Stages 6 + 7 run as three concurrent subtasks on separate
> instances. See [`workflows/app.py`](./workflows/app.py).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) (manages Python 3.13 automatically)
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 16+ (with pgvector extension >= 0.5.0, for the HNSW vector index)
- OpenAI API key
- Anthropic API key
- **Logfire account** — sign in at [logfire.pydantic.dev](https://logfire.pydantic.dev), create a project (US region), then:
  1. **Settings → Write Tokens** → create a token → `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` in `.env`
  2. **Settings → Read Tokens** → create a token → `LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN` in `.env`
  3. View traces in the **Live** panel under your project

### Local Development (with Make)

```bash
# 1. Install everything (uv installs Python 3.13 automatically)
make install

# 2. Set up .env file (copy from example and fill in your keys)
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start database
make db-start

# 4. Load documentation (this step might take a while!)
make ingest

# 5. Run backend (in one terminal)
make run-backend

# 6. Run frontend (in another terminal)
make run-frontend
```

> **Asking questions locally requires a deployed Workflow for now.** `POST /ask` delegates to a
> Workflows service; with nothing to delegate to it returns `503 WORKFLOW_SLUG is not configured`.
> But you can run the rest of the stack locally — no Render cloud resources, no API key — with a local dev server:
>
> ```bash
> # Terminal 1 — local workflow dev server (loads .env, listens on :8120)
> render workflows dev -- uv run render-workflows workflows.app:app
>
> # Terminal 2 — gateway pointed at the local dev server
> RENDER_USE_LOCAL_DEV=true WORKFLOW_SLUG=local \
>   uv run uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
>
> # Terminal 3 — frontend
> cd frontend && npm run dev
> ```
>
> `RENDER_USE_LOCAL_DEV=true` points the SDK at `http://localhost:8120` instead of Render's cloud
> (no token needed); `WORKFLOW_SLUG=local` just satisfies the gateway's guard. Set both in `.env`
> to skip the prefixes. The workflow runs against your local `DATABASE_URL`, so **History**
> populates normally. *(Alternatively, set `RENDER_API_KEY` + the real `WORKFLOW_SLUG` to target a
> deployed cloud Workflows service, which writes to its own database.)*

> **Local config → deployed env groups.** Locally every process reads one `.env` (copied from
> [`.env.example`](./.env.example)). On deploy that same config splits into the two Render env
> groups in [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml) — see [Deploy → Environment groups](#environment-groups).
> Local-only knobs (`RENDER_USE_LOCAL_DEV`, the Docker `DATABASE_URL`) aren't in any group; in the
> cloud the SDK uses the platform socket and `DATABASE_URL` is injected from the database.

`make ingest` runs the full pipeline: bulk doc embeddings, plus the curated "special pages" that get explicit-injection into RAG context (pricing, AI agent, autoscaling, Node.js). These live sources are defined in the [`data/sources.py`](./data/sources.py) registry and ingested through the shared build → embed → replace-by-source helpers. To re-load just one of those after editing its registry entry (or curated content), use the per-target shortcuts:

```bash
make add-pricing      # render.com/pricing tables
make add-ai-agent     # render.com/tutorials/agents-on-render-workflows (AI agents → Render Workflows)
make add-autoscaling  # render.com/docs/scaling
make add-nodejs       # render.com/docs/deploy-node-express-app
```

**Access locally:**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Logfire: https://logfire.pydantic.dev

## Deploy to Render

### 1. Set up a Logfire account.

Before clicking the deploy button, sign in at [logfire.pydantic.dev](https://logfire.pydantic.dev), create a project (US region), and generate two tokens:

- **Preferences → Write Tokens** → create token → save as `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`
- **Preferences → Read Tokens** → create token → save as `LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN`

You'll paste both into the Render Dashboard in step 3.

### 2. One-click deploy

<a href="https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/render-examples/pydantic-agents-workflows">
  <img src="https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg" alt="Deploy to Render" height="32">
</a>

Render reads [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml) and provisions:

- PostgreSQL database with pgvector (`pydantic-agents-workflows-db`)
- API gateway web service (`pydantic-agents-workflows-api`, FastAPI + Logfire)
- Ingestion refresh cron (`pydantic-agents-workflows-ingest`, triggers the workflow daily)
- Frontend static site (`pydantic-agents-workflows-frontend`, Next.js)
- Two **environment groups** that hold all shared config (see below)

On **Apply**, Render prompts once for the secret values in the env groups
(`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, both Logfire tokens, and — left blank for now —
`RENDER_API_KEY` / `WORKFLOW_SLUG`). You fill these at the **group** level, not per service.

#### Environment groups

`render.yaml` defines two reusable [env groups](https://render.com/docs/configure-environment-variables#environment-groups)
so config lives in one place instead of being duplicated across services:

| Group | Contents | Linked to |
|---|---|---|
| **`pydantic-agents-workflows-pipeline`** | LLM/Logfire secrets + all pipeline, RAG, and model config (~20 vars) | API gateway **and** the Workflows service (step 3) |
| **`pydantic-agents-workflows-pipeline-trigger`** | `RENDER_API_KEY`, `WORKFLOW_SLUG` | API gateway **and** the ingest cron |

The payoff is `pydantic-agents-workflows-pipeline`: the gateway and the Workflows service both run the same
`backend.config.Settings`, so they need identical config. Linking the group to the
hand-created Workflows service (step 3) replaces pasting ~20 variables by hand. `DATABASE_URL`
stays per-service (it's injected from the database, which can't live in a group), and the
frontend's `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` stays inline (unique, build-time).

### 3. Create the Workflows service

Blueprints (`render.yaml`) can't create Workflows yet, so do this once in the Dashboard.

**3a. Open the create form.** In the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com), click
**New → Workflow**. Connect this GitHub repo (or your fork) when prompted.

**3b. Fill in every field exactly as below:**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Name** | `pydantic-agents-workflows` (this becomes the workflow slug) |
| **Project / Environment** | Same project + `production` environment as the rest of the stack |
| **Language / Runtime** | `Python 3` |
| **Branch** | `main` (or the branch you deploy) |
| **Region** | `Oregon` (must match `pydantic-agents-workflows-db`) |
| **Root Directory** | *(leave blank — the repo root)* |
| **Build Command** | `pip install uv && uv sync --no-dev --frozen` |
| **Start Command** | `uv run render-workflows workflows.app:app` |
| **Instance Type** | `Standard` (the tasks are I/O-bound; no need for Pro) |

> **`uv: command not found`?** A hand-created Workflow service doesn't get `uv` pre-installed
> (unlike Blueprint services), so the build command installs it first with `pip install uv`.
>
> **Pin Python to 3.13.** The build may default to a newer Python (e.g. 3.14) and ignore the
> repo's `.python-version`. Add an env var **`PYTHON_VERSION` = `3.13`** in step 3c so the build
> matches `uv.lock` and the rest of the stack.

**3c. Configure the workflow environment.**

First, connect your workflow to the environment group you set up earlier. Select **Advanced**. Under **Linked Environment Groups**, choose **`pydantic-agents-workflows-pipeline`**.
   This pulls in both API keys, both Logfire tokens, and all pipeline/RAG/model config in one step.

Click **Deploy workflow**. While you're waiting for it to finish deploying, add the two variables that *can't* come from the group (env groups hold only plain `key: value` pairs — no database links):

In the left panel of your workflow service, select **Environment**. Under `Environment variables`, click the down arrow next to `Add variable` and choose **Datastore URL**. Select the database you provisioned in the blueprint step above, likely called `pydantic-agents-workflows-db`. Underneath the newly created variable, click the arrow next to `Save only` and choose `Save, rebuild, and register`.

Optionally, set `PYTHON_VERSION` to `3.13`. See the build note above.

The group's four secrets (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `LOGFIRE_TOKEN`,
`LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN`) are set once when applying the Blueprint (step 2) and reused here by linking the group — the first three are required and the service crashes on startup without them (no defaults in [`backend/config.py`](./backend/config.py)).


**3d. Copy the workflow slug** (shown on the Dashboard page / in its URL, e.g. `pydantic-agents-workflows`). You'll set it as `WORKFLOW_SLUG` in the `pydantic-agents-workflows-pipeline-trigger` group in step 4, which the gateway and cron
both inherit.

### 4. Fill in the env-group values

Because the gateway and cron read everything from the two env groups, you set values **on the
groups**, not on each service — every linked service picks them up automatically.

**`pydantic-agents-workflows-pipeline`** (drives the gateway + Workflows service). Set the four secrets once, when
you apply the Blueprint in step 2:

| Variable | Source |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) |
| `LOGFIRE_TOKEN` | Logfire write token from step 1 |
| `LOGFIRE_READ_TOKEN` | Logfire read token from step 1 |

**`pydantic-agents-workflows-pipeline-trigger`** (shared by the gateway + cron) — set these after the Workflows service
exists (step 3):

| Variable | Source |
|---|---|
| `RENDER_API_KEY` | [Render Account Settings → API Keys](https://dashboard.render.com/settings#api-keys) |
| `WORKFLOW_SLUG` | The Workflows service slug from step 3 (e.g. `pydantic-agents-workflows`) |

> Edit a group under **Dashboard → Env Groups → `<group>`**. Saving re-deploys every service
> linked to it, so the gateway and cron both pick up `WORKFLOW_SLUG` from a single edit.

Other env vars not mentioned explicitly here have been auto-filled for you.

### 5. Wire the frontend to the backend

After the gateway web service deploys, copy its public URL from the service's Dashboard page and set it as
the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` env var on the **frontend** service, then redeploy the frontend so the
value takes effect. For this deploy that's:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://pydantic-agents-workflows-api.onrender.com
```

Use the **base origin only** — no trailing slash and no `/api` path (the frontend appends
`/ask`, `/health`, etc. itself). If your service name isn't globally unique, Render adds a random
suffix (`…-api-xxxx.onrender.com`), so always copy the exact URL shown in the Dashboard.

Click **Save and rebuild**.

### 6. Seed the corpus, then done

The Workflows service has no documents until ingestion runs. Trigger it once to seed the DB
(the cron will keep it fresh afterward):

```bash
render workflows start ingest_all   # or start the ingest_all task in the Dashboard with no payload
```

### 7. (Optional) Smoke-test the pipeline from the Dashboard

Once the corpus is seeded, you can run the Q&A pipeline directly in the [Render dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com) — no frontend needed. In the
**Workflows service → Tasks**, start the **`run_qa_pipeline`** task with this input:

```
"How do I deploy an AI agent on Render?"
```

> **Security note — this is an open demo.** There's no authentication or rate limiting, and
> `POST /ask` triggers paid OpenAI + Anthropic calls on your keys. Before exposing a public
> fork, add auth and/or rate limiting to `POST /ask` and set `CORS_ORIGINS` to your frontend
> origin. See [Security & Deployment Posture](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md#security--deployment-posture).
