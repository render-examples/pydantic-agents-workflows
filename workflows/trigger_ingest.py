"""Trigger the ingestion fan-out workflow.

Run by a Render cron job (Workflows have no built-in scheduling) to refresh the
documentation corpus on a cadence. Also handy to run once manually after the
first Workflow deploy to seed the database.

Requires ``RENDER_API_KEY`` and ``WORKFLOW_SLUG`` in the environment.
